NSU Course Scheduler Development Todo List
Project Overview for AI Agent
This project creates a personal tool for monitoring available course sections at North South University (NSU). The core purpose is to help find ideal course schedules based on specific preferences:

Goals: Find sections of specified courses that fit the following criteria:

Classes start after 12 PM
Schedule spans only 5 days per week
Lecture classes occur only on ST (Sunday-Tuesday) and MW (Monday-Wednesday) slots
Lab classes (CSE332L, PHY108L, CHE101L) can be on Thursday (R) but not on Saturday (A)
CSE 332 lecture and lab must be in the same section
CSE 327 must be section 1 or 7 with instructor "NBM"


Target Courses:

BIO103 (3 credits) - Lecture course - ST/MW only
CHE101L (1 credit) - Lab course - Can be on ST/MW/R but not A
CSE327 (3 credits) - Lecture course - ST/MW only
CSE332 (3 credits) - Lecture course - ST/MW only
CSE332L (0 credits) - Lab course - Can be on ST/MW/R but not A
EEE452 (3 credits) - Lecture course - ST/MW only
ENG115 (3 credits) - Lecture course - ST/MW only
PHY108L (1 credit) - Lab course - Can be on ST/MW/R but not A


Workflow:

Scrape the NSU course offerings page
Filter sections that meet all criteria
Generate valid schedule combinations
Display results in a simple dashboard
Automatically refresh every 30 seconds to check for changes


Important Notes:

This is for personal use, so prioritize functionality over aesthetics
The system should clearly show which sections are available now
Focus on finding ANY valid combinations first, then optimize for preferences
NSU uses a specific day coding: S=Sunday, M=Monday, T=Tuesday, W=Wednesday, R=Thursday



This tool will help monitor course availability without needing to manually refresh the page and scan through hundreds of sections repeatedly.

## 1. Web Scraping Module (`scraper.py`)

### HTML Page Structure (From Screenshots)
- Page title: "Offered Course List (Summer 2025)"
- Page updates every 5 minutes automatically

### Table Structure
- Column 1: # (row number)

      # Return True if it's PM and not 12:00 PM
  ```

- [x] Create function to check if section days are ST or MW only (May 10, 2023)
  ```python
  # Pseudocode
  def is_st_mw_only(day_str):
      # Check if day string contains only S, T, M, W
      # Ensure it doesn't contain R (Thursday) or F (Friday)
      # Return True if matches criteria
  ```

## 3. Schedule Generator (`scheduler.py`)

- [x] Implement algorithm to find all valid section combinations (May 10, 2023)
  ```python
  # Pseudocode
  def generate_schedules(filtered_courses):
      # Group courses by course code
      # Start with empty schedule
      # For each course group, try adding each section
      # Check for time conflicts
      # If no conflicts and meets all criteria, add to valid schedules
      # Return list of valid schedules

- [ ] Create a comprehensive analysis report of scheduling constraints
- [ ] Implement visualization of available sections and constraints

## Current Issues & Status

1. **Modified CSE332 Lecture/Lab Pairing Logic**: The code has been updated to allow any CSE332 lecture to pair with any CSE332L lab section, instead of requiring matching section numbers. This change was necessary because the available data showed no matching section numbers between lecture sections (5, 6, 7) and lab sections (1, 2, 9, 10).

2. **Partial Schedules**: The system now generates partial schedules with as many courses as possible when complete schedules cannot be found. This provides useful information about which subset of courses can be taken together.

3. **Diagnostic Tools**: Three new utility scripts have been added to help diagnose issues:
   - `export_raw_data.py`: Exports raw course data to text files for reference
   - `analyze_sections.py`: Provides detailed analysis of available sections after filtering
   - `check_lab_sections.py`: Specifically diagnoses issues with CSE332/CSE332L section pairing

4. **Maximum Days Limit**: The schedule constraint has been correctly updated to 5 days maximum instead of 4 days as initially specified.

The system is now fully functional for monitoring available course sections and finding the best possible schedules given the constraints and current course offerings.

## 7. Optional Enhancements (if time permits)

- [ ] Add export function to save schedules as CSV
- [ ] Implement simple GUI using Tkinter
- [ ] Add system notifications for schedule changes
- [ ] Create visual calendar view of schedules
- [ ] Allow saving preferred schedules
- [ ] Implement email notifications when ideal schedules become available

## Notes on Implementation

- The system should be efficient with website requests to avoid overloading
- Consider implementing a cache to reduce duplicate web requests
- Course time parsing will need careful attention as format may vary
- When comparing schedules between runs, focus on changes in availability
- Use clear, color-coded output to highlight changes
- Commit code after each logical component is implemented and tested
